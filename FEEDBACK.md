# Exercise Feedback

## 1. What parts of this did you enjoy?

* **Full-Stack Scope**: Building a feature end-to-end, from the Laravel API to the React frontend, was very satisfying.
* **The Statistics Challenge**: The requirement to track and process API usage statistics was a great technical problem. Implementing the background jobs and scheduled tasks felt like building a real-world production feature.
* **Streamlined Docker Environment**: Using Laravel Sail to create a one-command setup was a highlight. It ensures a consistent development environment.
* **Real-World API Integration**: Interacting with the live Star Wars API made the task more practical, requiring consideration for error handling and data transformation.

## 2. What parts of this did you dislike?

* **Time vs. Polish**: With the time available, I prioritized core functionality over UI polish and comprehensive error states.
* **Testing Coverage**: While the testing framework is in place, I didn't have time to write as many tests as I would for a production application.

## 3. Any other comments/feedback?

**Overall impressions**:

The exercise is a great assessment of the skills needed for the role, as it mirrors the practical, day-to-day work of a full-stack developer. The combination of API development, frontend work, and background processing covers a realistic feature slice.

The problem is practical and relevant, avoiding abstract algorithm challenges in favor of a task that feels like it could be part of the actual LawnStarter platform.
