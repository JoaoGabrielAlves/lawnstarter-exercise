# Short Answer Questions

## 1. What are you hoping to find in your next position that would make us the right next step in your career?

I'm looking for a role where I can have real ownership and see my work make a tangible impact. What excites me about LawnStarter is the opportunity to build features that directly affect both customers and small business owners - that's the kind of meaningful work I want to be part of.

The full-stack nature of the role appeals to me because I enjoy working across the entire stack. I've been doing React and PHP/Laravel work, and I love being able to own a feature from the API design through to the user interface. The fact that you ship to production within the first week tells me this is a place where engineers can move fast and see results.

I'm also drawn to the growth opportunity you mentioned - the possibility of stepping into a Lead Engineer role within 6 months. I've been looking for a place where I can grow into more technical leadership while still staying hands-on with code.

## 2. What have you learned so far about us that has excited you?

A few things really stand out about LawnStarter:

First, you're solving a real problem. I've used similar services myself, and there's definitely a need for a reliable platform that connects homeowners with quality lawn care pros. The fact that you're profitable while scaling shows you've found product-market fit.

Your tech stack aligns well with what I enjoy working with - React, TypeScript, Laravel, and modern infrastructure with AWS and Kubernetes. I appreciate that you're using proven technologies rather than chasing every new trend.

The remote-first culture is important to me, especially the flexibility to set your own hours. I do my best work when I can optimize my schedule around when I'm most productive.

What really got my attention was learning about your mission to become the one-stop shop for outdoor home services. Starting with lawn care makes sense, but the bigger vision of expanding into other services shows there will be interesting technical challenges as you scale.

## 3. Have you worked in an environment where developers own delivering features all the way to production? Are you comfortable with this approach?

Yes, and I actually prefer it. In my current role, I'm responsible for taking features from initial requirements through deployment and monitoring. This includes writing the code, setting up CI/CD pipelines, and being on call for anything that breaks.

I find that when developers own the full lifecycle, we write better code because we know we'll be the ones debugging it at 2 AM if something goes wrong. It also means faster iteration - no waiting for other teams to deploy or troubleshoot issues.

I'm comfortable with:

- Deploying directly to production using automated pipelines
- Setting up monitoring and alerts for new features
- Responding to production incidents and doing root cause analysis
- Making database migrations and infrastructure changes

The combination of autonomy and responsibility is exactly what I'm looking for. I like that you mention having support from QA and Product Operations - that sounds like the right balance between ownership and having backup when needed.

## 4. What is the next technology or subject you are hoping to learn about?

I'm particularly interested in a few areas that would help me contribute more effectively to a growing platform like LawnStarter:

**Infrastructure and Scaling**: I want to get deeper into Kubernetes and Terraform. I've worked with Docker and basic cloud deployments, but I'd love to learn more about managing infrastructure as code and handling the scaling challenges that come with rapid growth.

**Performance Optimization**: As platforms grow, performance becomes critical. I'm interested in learning more about database optimization, caching strategies, and frontend performance - especially for mobile users who might be on slower connections.

**Real-time Features**: I think there's a lot of potential for real-time features in a service marketplace - live tracking, instant notifications, real-time chat between customers and pros. Learning about WebSockets and event-driven architectures would be valuable.

**Mobile Development**: I see you use React Native. I've done some mobile work but would love to get more experience building mobile-first experiences, especially since many of your users are probably on mobile when they need lawn care services.

These all seem directly relevant to the challenges LawnStarter faces as you scale and expand into new service categories.
