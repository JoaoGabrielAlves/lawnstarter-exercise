# Short Answer Questions

## 1. What are you hoping to find in your next position that would make us the right next step in your career?

I'm looking for a role with real ownership where my work has a tangible impact. The opportunity at LawnStarter to build features for both customers and small business owners is exactly the kind of meaningful work I'm seeking.

I enjoy full-stack development and owning features from API to UI, so the role is a great fit for my experience with React and Laravel. The mention of a path to a Lead Engineer role is also very appealing, as I'm looking to grow my technical leadership skills while remaining a hands-on contributor.

## 2. What have you learned so far about us that has excited you?

Several things about LawnStarter stand out. The company is solving a real, practical problem, and its profitability while scaling indicates strong product-market fit.

The tech stack (React, Laravel) aligns perfectly with my skills. I also value the remote-first culture and the flexibility it offers.

Most of all, I'm excited by the company's mission to become a one-stop shop for outdoor home services. This vision for growth promises interesting and complex technical challenges ahead.

## 3. Have you worked in an environment where developers own delivering features all the way to production? Are you comfortable with this approach?

Yes, I prefer that model and have experience with it. In my current role, I own features from requirements to deployment and monitoring, including CI/CD and on-call responsibilities.

I believe this ownership leads to higher-quality code and faster iteration. I am comfortable with deploying to production, setting up monitoring, handling incidents, and managing database or infrastructure changes.

The combination of developer autonomy with support from QA and Product Operations sounds like an ideal and effective environment.

## 4. What is the next technology or subject you are hoping to learn about?

I'm keen to learn more about a few topics relevant to LawnStarter's growth:

* **Infrastructure and Scaling**: Deepening my knowledge of cloud infrastructure and infrastructure-as-code to help manage a growing platform.
* **Performance Optimization**: Mastering database, caching, and frontend performance techniques to ensure a great user experience, especially on mobile.
* **Real-time Features**: Exploring event-driven architectures and WebSockets to build features like live tracking or instant notifications.
* **Mobile Development**: Gaining more experience in building mobile-first experiences, which seems critical for a service marketplace.
